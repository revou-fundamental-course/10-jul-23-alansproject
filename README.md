This is the BMI Calculator web project, coded by me (Alan Sadewa). I find that it is a good place for practicing my design and interactivity knowledge in CSS and Javascript.
I Created this project using these tools (without any frameworks):
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Vanilla Javascript

I got all the images from online resources, so the image is not mine. I admit that mobile illustration doesn't match the web,
because it is hard to find the better one and it is only for design.
